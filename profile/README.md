## Metering
We develop smart metering technologies for solar power projects and believe that smart metering can play a pivotal role in Africa's electric future.
Our meters collect and aggregate over 3,600 data points per minute, Switch's Smart Meter which means they are able to detect anomalies, system failures,
and power theft more efficiently than any other meter on the market. They can provide detailed data about the energy usage in your customer's
homes. This information would allow you to better tailor your power plans based on actual usage patterns

[Switch Electric](https://www.whynotswitch.com) is building a web3 metering infrastructure and a platform for tokenizing rooftop solar assets. We aim to create the technological infrastructure needed for a decentralized energy internet and peer-to-peer marketplace, where producers can sell excess energy directly at wholesale prices. We envision a cost-effective decentralized energy internet for all of Africa's 1 billion people by the year 2100. We believe that the future of energy is decentralized, because it is sustainable and resilient, thus the best way to achieve universal access to energy.

Maxwell Smart Meter is a game-changing new technology developed by Switch Electric, built on the power of real-time sensors and web3 technologies to enable complex metering services in decentralized energy systems such as microgrids. In the span of just one minute, a smart meter can collect and analyzes over 3,600 data points from several different sensors, including voltage, current, frequency and power factor. Using this data, the meter is able to calculate a very accurate reading of the energy being produced or consumed by any resource connected to it.
